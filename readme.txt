Instructions:

1. With flatlabel.zip unzipped, make the following changes to the site files (in alphabetical order) before uploading:

   1a. contact.php — If you intend on using the built-in contact form, change youremail@website.com to the email where you want to receive messages and Inquiry | Site Name to the subject line you would like to be used.

   1b. favicon.ico — This is the icon that appears next to the URL of the page you're on in web browsers. Using your favorite graphics editor, and starting with a larger space, say 100x100 pixels, create an icon that represents your site. Then size it down to 32x32 pixels, save as png, convert it to ico with convertico.com or a similar tool, and replace the blank favicon file in your site files.

   1c. robots.txt — This is the file that gives directions to search engines like Google on what to and what not to index. Change website.com to your domain.

   1d. sitemap.xml — This is the file that provides a map of all the pages that exist on your site, which you wish for people and bots to easily find. Change website.com to your domain and add any additional pages you want to list in the sitemap.

2. Now, you can upload all the site files to the root folder (usually public_html) of your domain on your hosting account, via FTP. If you don't have a host yet, see: https://bryanhadaway.com/web-hosting-guide-how-do-i-find-the-right-web-host-for-me/. If you're not sure how to use FTP, I recommend using FileZilla, which your host should likely have specific instructions on using in their documentation.

3. Now that everything is in place, simply visit yourwebsite.com/?login. The default password is password, change this to a real password immediately and login.

4. When logged in, you'll find a Settings panel at the bottom of the page. Here, you can change the theme if you've installed other themes or creating your own, you can change the menu by renaming the default example pages and adding completely new menu items, which will create the page as well, on a new line, and finally, change the Site Title and copyright lines. Simply click "Update" once you've made the desired changes.

5. The other place in which you can make real-time edits to the content on the front-end of the site, is the page content areas. Of course, if you're comfortable with code, feel free to customize the back-end code as much as you like as well.
